## Introduction

Optimizing the order in which a database management system executes joins is a well-studied topic in database management [literature](cite:cites vellev2009review). The order of join operator execution significantly impacts the performance characteristics of queries. In classical relational database literature, three main approaches are studied: algorithms based on dynamic programming, random improvement, and heuristic searches [](cite:cites kossmann2000iterative). In recent literature, reinforcement learning(RL)-based query optimizers achieve impressive results. Most RL-based optimizers use a greedy search procedure guided by a trained value function that can predict the long-term cost of (partial) join plans. Recent [work](cite:cites marcus2019neo) shows that learned optimizers can match and even surpass state-of-the-art commercial optimizers. In SPARQL, machine or reinforcement learning is primarily used to predict query performance, however, besides the optimizer used in [April](cite:cites wang2020april), there is a surprising absence of RL-based query optimizers. The April optimizer uses an approach similar to relational database optimizers, however, it is simplistic and not extensively covered in the paper. Thus, we propose to fill this gap in the literature by introducing a fully-fledged RL-based query optimizer for SPARQL join order optimization.
