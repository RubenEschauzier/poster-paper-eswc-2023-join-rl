## Introduction

<!-- Optimizing the order in which a database management system executes joins is a well-studied topic in database management [literature](cite:cites vellev2009review). The order of join operator execution significantly impacts the performance characteristics of queries.  -->
<!-- In classical relational database literature, three main approaches are studied: algorithms based on dynamic programming, random improvement, and heuristic searches [](cite:cites kossmann2000iterative).  -->
<!-- In recent literature, reinforcement learning(RL)-based query optimizers achieve impressive results. Most RL-based optimizers use a greedy search procedure guided by a trained value function that can predict the long-term cost of (partial) join plans. Recent [work](cite:cites marcus2019neo) shows that learned optimizers can match and even surpass state-of-the-art commercial optimizers. In SPARQL, machine or reinforcement learning is primarily used to predict query performance, however, besides the optimizer used in [April](cite:cites wang2020april), there is a surprising absence of RL-based query optimizers. The April optimizer uses an approach similar to relational database optimizers, however, it is simplistic and not extensively covered in the paper. Thus, we propose to fill this gap in the literature by introducing a fully-fledged RL-based query optimizer for SPARQL join order optimization. We expect RL-based approaches to perform well for static datasets with a public SPARQL endpoint. -->
Optimizing the order in which database management systems execute joins is a well-studied topic in database [literature](cite:cites vellev2009review). The order in which joins are executed significantly impacts the performance characteristics of queries. 
In recent literature, reinforcement learning(RL)-based optimizers that use greedy search procedures guided by a learned value function achieve impressive results. [Neo](cite:cites marcus2019neo) shows that learned optimizers can match and even surpass state-of-the-art commercial optimizers. In SPARQL, machine learning is primarily used to predict query performance, however these approaches (Should I use this space to cite them?) use supervised machine learning with a static dataset and use methods that exploit the static nature of the dataset. Learned query optimizers use reinforcement learning to dynamically generate training data by exploring the search space, thus complicating the use of existing query performance prediction methods. The [April](cite:cites wang2020april) optimizer uses reinforcement learning for query optimization, however its approach to encoding the query state into a feature vector is relatively simplistic and the paper does not report any performance characteristics. We fill this gap in the literature by exploring a fully-fledged RL-based query optimizer for SPARQL join order optimization. We expect RL-based approaches to perform well for static datasets with a public SPARQL endpoint. We model our approach after the [RTOS](cite:cites yu2020reinforcement) optimizer for relational queries, which uses Tree-LSTM layers to learn the Q-function that represents the expected cost of a (partial) join plan, given optimal decisions.
