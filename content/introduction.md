## Introduction

Optimizing the order in which a database management system executes joins is a well studied topic in database management [literature](cite:cites vellev2009review). The order in which join operators are executed greatly influences the performance characteristics of queries. In classical relational database literature three main approaches are studied; algorithms based on dynamic programming, random improvement, and heuristic searches [](cite:cites kossmann2000iterative). In the recent years a new type of heuristic search achieves impressive results: reinforcement learning-based query optimizers. Most reinforcement learning-based optimizers use a greedy search guided by a trained value function that can predict the long-term cost of (partial) join plans. Recent [work](cite:cites marcus2019neo) shows that learned optimizers can match and in some cases surpass the state-of-the-art commercial optimizers. In SPARQL machine or reinforcement learning is primarily used to predict query performance, howerever besides the optimizer used in [April](cite:cites wang2020april), there is a suprising absence of reinforcement learning-based query optimizers. The april optimizer uses an approach that is similar to relational database optimizers, however it is simplistic and not extensively covered in the paper. Thus, we propose to fill this gap in literature by introducing a fully fledged reinforcement learning-based query optimizer for SPARQL join order optimization.
