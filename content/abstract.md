## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In recent years, relational databases successfully leverage reinforcement learning to optimize query plans.
<!-- Need         -->
For graph databases and RDF quad stores, such research has been limited, so there is a need to understand the impact of reinforcement learning techniques.
<!-- Task         -->
We explore a reinforcement learning-based join plan optimizer that we design specifically for optimizing join plans during SPARQL query planning. 
<!-- Object       -->
This paper presents key aspects of this method and highlights open research problems. 
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that while we can reuse aspects of relational database optimization,
SPARQL query optimization presents unique challenges not encountered in relational databases. 
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Nevertheless, initial benchmarks show promising results
<!-- Perspectives -->
that warrant further exploration.
