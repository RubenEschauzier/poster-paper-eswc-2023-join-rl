## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In recent years, relational databases successfully leverage reinforcement learning to optimize query plans.
<!-- Need         -->
Within graph databases and RDF quad stores,
such research has been limited,
so there is aÂ need to understand the impact of reinforcement learning techniques.
<!-- Task         -->
We explore a reinforcement learning-based join plan optimizer,
that we design specifically for the selecting of join plans during SPARQL query planning.
<!-- Object       -->
In this paper, we present the key aspects of this method and highlight open research problems.
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that while some aspects of relational database optimization can be reused,
SPARQL query optimization presents unique challenges not encountered in relational databases. 
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Nevertheless, initial benchmarks show promising results
<!-- Perspectives -->
that warrant further exploration.
