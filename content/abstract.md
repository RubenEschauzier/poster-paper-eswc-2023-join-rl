## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In recent years,
relational databases have been successfully leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize query plans.
In contrast, research into investigating the benefits of reinforcement learning in the context of graph databases and SPARQL query optimization has been limited.
<!-- Need         -->
As such, there are opportunities for applying these existing techniques to SPARQL query optimization.
<!-- Task         -->
We explore a reinforcement learning-based join plan optimizer,
that we design specifically for the selecting of join plans during SPARQL query planning.
<!-- Object       -->
In this poster paper we present the key aspects of this method and highlight open research problems.
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that while some aspects of relational database optimization can be reused,
SPARQL query optimization presents unique challenges not encountered in relational databases. 
Nevertheless, initial benchmarks show promising results.
