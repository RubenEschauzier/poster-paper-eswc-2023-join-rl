## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Relational databases successfully leverage reinforcement learning to optimize query plans.
<!-- Need         -->
This approach has been insufficiently translated to SPARQL query optimization.
<!-- Task         -->
We will develop a reinforcement learning-based join plan optimizer, based on relational databases approaches, that works for SPARQL query optimization.
<!-- Object       -->
In this poster paper we present some key aspects of our method and highlight open research problems.
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that while some aspects of relational database optimization can be reused, SPARQL query optimization presents unique challenges 
not encountered in relational databases.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<!-- Perspectives -->
